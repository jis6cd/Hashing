# Hashing

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a Word Puzzle, Hash Table, and timer. The goal was to create a program that would find all the English words in a word puzzle under a certain amount of time. This was done using a Hash Table.

Note that some of the code and comments were provided to the students from our professor, but the majority of the work was done by the student.
